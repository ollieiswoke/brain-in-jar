### TL;DR

All chords progressions work in reverse. They don't feel the same, they just still 'work'. 
    
This is the same for melodies as well.

### How does it work?

First let's establish terms a little bit. What even is a chord progression? How do they work?

A chord can be defined as multiple notes being played at the same(ish) time.

Conventionally, people will start using roman numerals to descibe chords in relation to the key centre. E.g. I=Cmaj, ii=Dmin, ... iivâš¬=Bdim. Then they will tell you that V->I sounds really good and will talk a lot about chord progressions that involve descending fifths. This model is really good for explaining the 'Dominant to Tonic' harmony that occurs very often in classical music to resolve a piece. It also explains things like the ii-V-I (Look at the root notes, they are descending by fifths). However, I find it this model (at this level of detail) is not enough information to help people understand *why* harmonies work or don't work. Sure, V->I sounds super hecking resolved. What about relations that don't jump up or down by 5ths? 

It doesn't help people understand the types of harmony they see in the wild e.g. if I gave you one of the most common pop chord progressions C->E->F (I III IV) and the information above you would have no idea how to explain why E->F feels interesting. Also, how do we explain chords with accidental notes? or chords that are ambiguous? Or chords that are in key signatures that are ambiguous?

To sidestep this kerfuffle, the primary way I think about harmony is as voice leading - that is, several little melodies happening at once. To be clear conventional harmony discussions will understand that voice leading is the underlying force of harmony, but they will not follow this idea to it's conclusions. Many of the observations I will make in this blog will come from the assumption that harmony can be understood through voice leading. It's an idea that Jacob Collier popularised in modern musical discussions, if you're interested, I find his [June Lee interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnBr070vcNE&list=PL-Jmv0F9REwjz17Fv7_Ck0W7jqZOirIdV&index=1) and [berklee masterclass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSPXgdeKLTs) super insightful.
