### TL;DR

All chords progressions work in reverse. They don't feel the same, they just still 'work'. 

This is the same for melodies as well.

### distance of interval > direction of interval

When a note jumps up a fifth or down a fifth, it sounds very similar. The direction of the jump isn't super important in determining the sound, but the *distance* of the jump is. 

And a chord progression is just a series of notes jumping and and down. If I were strumming on the guitar, you can interpret what I play as 6 different melodies - one for each string. 

So if we assume:
1. Harmony can be interpreted as a series of melodies playing simultaneously.
2. Melodies get their feel from the distance between each note. Whether a note jumps up or down doesn't really matter. 

Then reversing a a chord progression will create an equally 'valid' chord progression.

### Why is this useful?

When you don't understand how something works, it can feel like you're just trying random stuff until something works. This was definitely my experience - just messing around on the piano until I discovered something. So the realisation that chord progressions work backwards is super cool because it lets us double our rewards every time we do find something, potentially increasing our harmonic toolset.
